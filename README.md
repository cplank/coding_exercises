## Lessons learned
So many lessons learned! Some of my solutions are so ridiculous I literally laughed at them, but that's the fun of learning - going back and making them more elegant and efficient. My first goal is always to solve the problem at hand, no matter how many square pegs I have to fit into round holes to make it happen. My second goal is to refine, refine, refine! And at the end, it's always great to see how other people approached the solution and learn from that as well.
